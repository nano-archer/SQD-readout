A script from my work on my bachelor project: Fabrication and measurement of hybrid quantum dot devices featuring Yu-Shiba-Rosinov sub-gap states


A readout of characteristics for a single quantum dot diamond plot. 
The script will find the transition lines at given x and y values at calculate certain parameters that descripes the single quantum dot system. 
The point behind the script was to make the data treatment fast and easy. 
Our measurements would give us the three-dimensional data, which I could put into this script.
It is set up to match the measurement system implemented at my department at University of Copenhagen, called Center of Quantum Devices (QDev)
